# Milestone 012: Comprehensive README

**Completed:** 2026-02-09

## Summary
Added a comprehensive README.md to the project root, designed as a self-contained technical introduction for a CS professor overseeing the independent study. Covers architecture, tech stack, data model (Mermaid ER diagram), end-to-end feature walkthroughs, full API reference, frontend routes, security model, and annotated project structure.

## Key Changes
- `README.md` - NEW: Full project documentation (~450 lines) with ASCII architecture diagram, Mermaid ER diagram, numbered feature walkthroughs (auth, messaging, invites), API endpoint table, and security model explanation

## Decisions
- Omitted prompts feature from the README since the implementation is likely to change
- No setup instructions in README — single-line reference to `docs/dev-notes.md` instead
- Used text, tables, ASCII art, and Mermaid only — no images
